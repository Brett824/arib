Forked off https://github.com/johnoneil/arib/, for all relevant info and specifics on ARIB, see the README in that repo.

For this fork, I've updated the code for Python 3 (Python 2 is past end of life) as well as fixing a couple bugs and adopting more standard Python formatting. I'm not 100% on the ARIB spec sheet and mostly adapted this via general debugging -- there may be minor issues caused by the Python 3 migration but I have verified it produces the same output for several TS files.
